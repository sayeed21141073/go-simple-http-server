# go-simple-http-server

This is a simple HTTP server written in Go that serves a list of users stored in a struct. It demonstrates how to create a struct, initialize a slice of structs, define a function to handle HTTP requests, and use the net/http package to start an HTTP server and register custom handlers. When you visit the /users route in your web browser, the server will return a list of users stored in the users slice. This project is a good starting point for learning how to create HTTP servers in Go and how to work with structs and slices.
